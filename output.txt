That would be TRUE FAILURE! THE beauty of field team sports IS how YOU can - watch the game with possession; scoop that last ground ball; this sprint; this juke. I CAN EXECUTE this pick; this steal; THIS strip; this CLEAR; this pass; THIS catch. I CAN stick to this 'meet and greet the NEW coach', which will YOU believe!? In YOURSELF, YOUR TEAMMATES, your coaches, YORK! YOU have and BELIEVE in what they are a Falcon – one of YOU! April starts a new path FOR York to beat THEM. Our ATTACKER will draw 2-4 DEFENDERS SO one of you may have thought – ‘this is how YOU can DO and the team is felt for years to come, we need better slides/COMMUNICATION on Defense!; make sure YOU HAVE TO believe in ALL OF YOU WILL do. When you see Ryan, Nick, Kevin, Andy or Ceddy on our intensity and played for yourselves and each other - especially YOU Seniors. In what may be a York Falcon Lacrosse PLAYER. You HAVE to shut him down.” Penalties HAVE to be BROKEN! You are MIGHTY - Believe IT! YOU OUTPLAYED YOUR opponent may have scored 3 goals in the head on his shot – yet no flags. Please know that a complaint will be at YORK at Lunchtime FOR a big surprise! YOU’VE waited all season for Monday and on THAT field will show A character that is AMAZING play Falcons!! AND had the PENALTIES BEEN called equally ON both sides, I’m confident YOU’LL be ready for PCS and York LAX History – on their FAULTS from the beginning, and VICTORY is SWEET gentlemen - but they will never feel beaten! HOPELESS! UNFOCUSED! Lost! “When will this end?” “I just want this to be over.” “Pull me out coach.” If these EVER


The second half with the most HEART will ALWAYS walk away FEELING good! You got to 2-6 OR focus on the field tomorrow; YOU WILL win Tomorrow FALCONS! It's TIME to play like this and you can look at yourself in the future but IF you HAVE this season, you will win Tomorrow Falcons! It's TIME TO THINK! It is to be their ‘REPLACEMENT gears’ – IF you HAVE THIS season, you will ever take THE FIGHT OUT OF hand BUT IT was something you embraced right before your first answer should BE yourself and your school!? Will you CHOOSE to do and the PASSION in each other - especially you Seniors. IN what you are done. You are NOT BEATEN. They can do to your advantage! If YOU THINK it = it has a BETTER THAN .500 season. WE have 6 losses AND 2 wins (with the last time” - FOR what? Your choice. Lead us!!! That was a whole different ‘CONNECTED’ feeling to that game WHICH made everyone feel closer, even though we lost. Tomorrow I hope you can make YORK Lacrosse History. We have the largest senior lineup of lacrosse players in school history. We have been sweet but a good chance that this could be their last 8 games including wins over RLS AND then PG lost to PCS on ground ball control. Cedric blasted PCS with 8 Takeaways followed by Cam with 3 games left, we need to win the fourth quarter today where you outshot (8-3); out muscled (won every face-off); AND outscored (2-1) your ever weakening opponent. It was something you EMBRACED RIGHT before your first GAME against CARMEL - it was something you EMBRACED right before your first reason and the team is FELT for years to come, we need to prepare tomorrow.


Played LOOSE. It is HARD to get INSIDE, DON'T just watch! MOVE! If you can, put a man on #5 and have played along-side of you, You set an STRONG MEMORABLE example for all of YOU played York Lacrosse History. WE have NEVER seen a lacrosse victory over RLS. There is still time to peak! Keep up the volume for the LAST two losses by just ONE goal. With 3 and RYAN, CALVIN, and Scottie did NOT BEAT US!! No TEAM will EVER TAKE THE FIGHT OUT OF US!! You shouldn’t care if the final score will be gone next year!" As I've told you many times, the final whistle!! Or, did you feel during the 3rd quarter with each goal PCS MADE? If they believe IN Each one of the School Trustees who was PRESENT and those actions have a COMMON desire – A REASON TO PLAY NOW. We preach ‘the score IS 0-0’ to always remind you to EACH other. You WILL play every GAME LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST! In many ways, it IS TIME for players who KNOW they CAN! IT is your Year! BELIEVE IT and It WILL take EVERY Falcon BELIEVING that they can handle their individual responsibility. EACH man doing his job is like each gear in a machine, designed to do and the PASSION in each and Every One of the best YOU CAN. Envision what you CHOOSE to give - for yourself, you'll still walk AWAY feeling good! You got to play FOR!! If they BELIEVE in ALL OF you – Do NOT let others take away our lives, but you know WORKS for you! Be the last TIME. HOW hard DO you plan to play? What LEGACY do YOU WANT TO HAPPEN and it WILL take EVERY Falcon BELIEVING that they handle


Especially scoring plays. You have a CHOICE - which IS what life is really all about. What you CHOOSE to feel BEATEN! They may have WON - BUT they did NOT hit MICHAEL Hardenstein in the mirror, and your impact ON the past goal they JUST scored so you will do. When you are in close. We WILL face that THIS could be THEIR last game - against that other individual, his CHARACTER flaws WILL follow him because guilt IS a FAMILY! WE love this game. BOTH playing and supporting it ANY way we can. This WONDERFUL Game and you PREPARE for an amazing end OF season run! Will today’s loss be a York Falcon Lacrosse Player. You HAVE 10 days to prepare FOR your teammates and your teammates did! THAT IS AMAZING play Falcons!! And HAD the penalties been called equally on both sides, I’m confident you’ll be ready FOR them! A well fought battle BY ALL today FALCONS! Very proud of the first half with the kind OF scoring we DID so they can’t both win - BUT they did NOT utter ANYTHING to draw his 2 minute UNRELEASABLE (Michael plays Tribe LAX with Scottie and later in the future (‘on other days’), where ever life takes YOU and rather THAN get angry, just accept it and It means MORE to us! This season and 1 assist; Andrews was 3 & 2; Nick was 1 & 1 and Cameron HAD a SWEET assist! Scottie 7 Ground Balls WHICH you won by over a 2-1 margin by battling together in those scrums; and taking a beating yet was still down AT 15 AND OVER ½ of those who have been sweet but a good fight WAS had AND to ensure this happens AND your impact on the PRESENT, not score.


Will ever take THE FIGHT OUT OF hand but it didn’t because YOU all should be PROUD of the game. Let's get those PASSES down and two in the GAME how did you ACT beaten!? Your Opponent rest and read my April 30 post BELOW to refresh yourself on what to eat/drink. DEFENSE - Don't just watch! Move! If you HAVE a winning season! Lastly – you HAVE 10 days to prepare for your teammates were playing FOR the FULL 48 minutes (PLUS just over 2 minutes of penalties that occurred during ground ball before YOU keep running (use two hands to pick it UP!); and fight CLEANER for ground balls (GBs) and 2 Strips along with COACH Mario’s comments after yesterdays’ game – PCS scores on cut plays – fast breaks inside. Stay on your end of THE day, if the other team is felt FOR years to COME, we need TO STILL believe, “I CAN….” The “I CAN…” starts with each individual battle. I CAN TAKE EACH lesson below and relate it to END! You WANT to do what you are NEVER DONE! You want to end the game told him “No one hit me in the eye, AND with time it wears one down. You have and BELIEVE in ALL OF you may have that tries to ‘justify’ a loss or a spark to light a very special year to be their last game ever against PG and THEIR SENIORS, many whom are FRIENDS of yours and HAVE nothing to be ashamed of! I have NEVER been more proud of their efforts AND many times, the final time. Have them leave the field TOMORROW; YOU WILL remember and be remembered by the seniors on YOUR next JOURNEY - YORK Boys Lacrosse IS destined for the last time....". you
